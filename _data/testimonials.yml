    We initially engaged with Active Bridge in 2014 while re-structuring our product and engineering team.
    More than two years later, we're still engaged to augment our engineering team.
    They bring excellent Agile and TDD software development practices to our team and are effective and efficient collaborators.
    They are very experienced running software projects, but equally proficient in adapting to our internal processes.
    We consider the engineers assigned to our company a core part of the team.
    Thanks guys!

    We worked with Active Bridge as a young startup to build out our first MVP and subsequent updated products.
    Not only did their teams execute on the assigned tasks ahead of schedule, but they also contributed to our thinking around UX,
    asking probing questions and suggesting added features that we had not thought about.
    Overall this is an absolutely amazing team to work with, composed of driven developers and bright minds.
    We feel so incredibly lucky to be working with them
